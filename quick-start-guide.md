## 🎯 What You'll Accomplish This Week

By Friday, your students will have completed their first AI literacy self-assessment, learned the THINK Framework for responsible AI use, and practiced applying critical thinking to AI interactions. This guide provides a simple, actionable plan to introduce the Prompted platform in just **three class sessions**.

## 📅 Your 3-Day Implementation Plan

### **Day 1: Baseline Assessment (15 minutes)**

**Objective:** Students establish their current AI literacy level through self-reflection.

Begin by explaining to your students that artificial intelligence tools are becoming essential in education and careers, but using them effectively requires specific skills. Today they will take a brief self-assessment to understand their current relationship with AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot.

Direct students to the **AI Literacy Self-Assessment** (Section 1 in the platform). Students can access this through the full workbook or the public preview page. They will rate themselves on twelve statements covering three key areas: their understanding of AI capabilities, their habits when using AI tools, and their ability to think critically about AI outputs.

After students calculate their scores, facilitate a brief class discussion. Ask volunteers to share which mastery level they achieved—Emerging, Developing, or Strategic—without requiring them to reveal specific scores. This creates psychological safety while normalizing the learning journey. Emphasize that most students begin in the Emerging or Developing range, and that growth is the goal rather than perfection.

**Teacher tip:** Take the assessment yourself before class and share your own results. This models vulnerability and demonstrates that AI literacy is a learning process for everyone, including educators.

### **Day 2: The THINK Framework (20 minutes)**

**Objective:** Students learn a practical five-step framework for responsible AI interaction.

Introduce the THINK Framework as a strategic approach to using AI tools. Explain that effective AI users do not simply accept whatever the tool generates—they apply critical thinking at every stage of the interaction.

Present each component of THINK using the framework guide in Section 2:

**T - Target Your Goal:** Before opening an AI tool, students must clearly define what they want to accomplish. Are they brainstorming ideas, getting feedback on writing, or learning a new concept? The clearer the goal, the better the AI interaction.

**H - Handle with Care:** Students should treat AI tools as powerful assistants that require careful instruction. This means writing specific prompts, providing context, and setting clear parameters rather than vague requests.

**I - Investigate the Output:** Critical evaluation is essential. Students must read AI responses carefully, checking for accuracy, bias, and relevance. They should ask themselves whether the output actually addresses their goal.

**N - Navigate Verification:** Students need strategies for fact-checking AI outputs. This includes cross-referencing with trusted sources, consulting subject matter experts, and recognizing when AI responses require verification.

**K - Keep Ownership:** Students must maintain their role as the primary thinker and creator. AI should enhance their work, not replace their thinking. This means revising, personalizing, and taking responsibility for final products.

After presenting the framework, work through a live example as a class. Choose a common student task—such as writing a paragraph about a historical event or solving a math word problem—and demonstrate how to apply each THINK step. Invite students to suggest improvements to your prompts and evaluation strategies.

**Teacher tip:** Create a visual anchor chart with the THINK Framework and post it prominently in your classroom. Students will reference this throughout the year as they develop AI literacy habits.

---

### **Day 3: Hands-On Practice (25 minutes)**

**Objective:** Students apply the THINK Framework to a real AI interaction and reflect on the process.

Assign students a low-stakes task that requires AI interaction. Choose something aligned with your current curriculum—for example, asking an AI tool to explain a concept you are studying, generate practice questions, or provide feedback on a draft paragraph.

Students should complete the **AI Interaction Log** (Section 3 in the platform) as they work. This structured worksheet guides them through documenting their goal, the prompt they used, the AI's response, their evaluation of that response, and the actions they took to verify or improve the output.

Circulate as students work, observing how they apply the THINK Framework. Look for common challenges: vague prompts that produce unhelpful responses, uncritical acceptance of AI outputs, or difficulty articulating their goals. Use these observations to provide targeted coaching.

After students complete their logs, facilitate a reflection discussion. Ask questions like: What surprised you about the AI's response? How did your prompt affect the quality of the output? What verification strategies did you use? What would you do differently next time?

**Teacher tip:** Consider having students work in pairs for this first practice session. Collaborative problem-solving helps students learn from each other's approaches and builds confidence before independent work.

## 🔧 Platform Access Options

The Prompted platform is designed to work in any classroom environment, whether you have one-to-one devices, shared computers, or no technology access during class time.

**High-Tech Classroom (1:1 devices):** Students access the platform directly through the web browser. They can complete interactive forms online, save their progress, and share results digitally. Provide students with the platform URL and password.

**Medium-Tech Classroom (shared devices):** Rotate students through computer stations to complete assessments and logs, or project the platform on a screen and complete activities as a whole class with individual reflection time.

**Low-Tech Classroom (print-based):** Download and print the worksheets as PDFs using your browser's print function. Students complete paper versions and store them in a dedicated AI literacy folder or notebook.

**Hybrid Approach:** Use the platform for demonstration and whole-class instruction while providing printed worksheets for individual student work. This combines the visual impact of the interactive platform with the accessibility of paper resources.

## 📊 What Comes Next

After this three-day introduction, your students will have established a foundation for ongoing AI literacy development. The platform includes resources to sustain this learning throughout the semester.

The **8-Week Implementation Guide** (Section 11) provides a structured curriculum that gradually builds skills from basic awareness to strategic mastery. Each week focuses on a specific competency, with corresponding worksheets and activities.

The **Lesson Plans** (Section 9) offer detailed instructional sequences for teaching concepts like prompt engineering, bias detection, and ethical AI use. These can be integrated into your existing curriculum across subject areas.

The **Student Worksheets** (Sections 3-8) provide ongoing practice opportunities. Use these as homework assignments, bell ringers, or embedded activities within content lessons. Students can track their growth by retaking the AI Literacy Self-Assessment periodically.

The **Teacher Tools & Admin Resources** (Section 12) include discussion prompts, assessment rubrics, and guidance for addressing common student misconceptions about AI.

## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

**Start with transparency.** Explain to students why AI literacy matters for their future. Share examples of how AI is already affecting their lives—from social media algorithms to college admissions essays—and position these skills as essential for success.

**Model your own learning.** Share your experiences with AI tools, including mistakes and surprises. When you demonstrate that AI literacy is a developing skill rather than innate knowledge, students feel more comfortable taking risks.

**Connect to current curriculum.** Do not treat AI literacy as an add-on. Instead, integrate THINK Framework practice into existing assignments. When students write essays, solve problems, or conduct research, explicitly incorporate AI tool use with critical evaluation.

**Create a culture of verification.** Celebrate students who catch AI errors or challenge AI outputs. Make fact-checking and critical thinking visible and valued in your classroom community.

**Adjust the pace.** This three-day plan provides a strong start, but some classes may need more time for discussion or practice. Use your professional judgment to extend activities or add scaffolding as needed.
