## Transformation Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix Navigation & Accessibility
1. Match all navigation IDs to actual section IDs
2. Remove inaccessible sections (resources, advisory-board, etc.) or add nav for them
3. Ensure clicking nav items shows correct sections

### Phase 2: Reframe Manager-Led to Employee Self-Directed

#### Current Manager-Led Language to Remove/Change:

**"Training Sessions" Section:**
- ❌ "Training Session 1: AI Literacy"
- ❌ "Training Session 2: Strategic Questioning"
- ❌ "Deliver this session to your team"
- ❌ "Facilitator notes"
- ✅ Change to: "Learning Module 1", "Complete this module", "Self-paced learning"

**"Manager Planning Tool":**
- ❌ "What is the primary professional development objective for this project?"
- ❌ Manager-focused questions
- ✅ Change to: "Individual Learning Plan" or "Personal AI Integration Worksheet"

**"Team Implementation Readiness":**
- ❌ Manager assessing team
- ✅ Change to: "My Workplace Readiness" (employee assessing their environment)

**"Quick Start Guide":**
- ❌ "3-Day Implementation for Managers"
- ✅ Change to: "3-Day Quick Start for Employees"

**General Language:**
- ❌ "Deliver to your team"
- ❌ "Facilitate this session"
- ❌ "Manager implements"
- ❌ "Team training"
- ✅ "Complete this module"
- ✅ "Learn at your own pace"
- ✅ "Self-directed learning"
- ✅ "Individual practice"

### Phase 3: Reorganize Content for Self-Paced Learning

**Keep & Enhance:**
- ✅ Assessment (already individual-focused)
- ✅ ROI Calculator (for managers/L&D, keep as-is)
- ✅ Microlearning (perfect for self-paced)
- ✅ Learning Paths (perfect for self-paced)
- ✅ Certification (individual credential)
- ✅ THINK Framework (universal tool)
- ✅ Worksheets (individual practice)
- ✅ Activities (hands-on learning)

**Transform:**
- 🔄 "Training Sessions" → "Learning Modules"
- 🔄 "Manager Planning Tool" → "Personal Planning Worksheet"
- 🔄 "Team Readiness" → "Workplace Readiness Self-Check"
- 🔄 "Quick Start for Managers" → "Quick Start for Employees"
- 🔄 "Implementation Guides" → "Self-Paced Learning Guides"

**Remove or Repurpose:**
- ❌ Manager-only tools (unless clearly labeled for managers/L&D only)
- ❌ Facilitation scripts
- ❌ Team delivery instructions

## Implementation Steps

1. **Fix Navigation IDs** - Ensure all nav links match section IDs
2. **Audit Content** - Document what's in each section
3. **Rewrite Manager Language** - Convert to employee self-directed
4. **Test Every Section** - Click through all 14+ sections
5. **Verify Accessibility** - Ensure all content is reachable
6. **Save Checkpoint** - Deliver transformed workbook
