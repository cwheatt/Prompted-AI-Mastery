# Corporate AI Training Delivery Model Research

## SmarterX AI Academy - Delivery Model

**Source:** https://academy.smarterx.ai/

### Key Findings:

**SELF-PACED, EMPLOYEE-DIRECTED LEARNING**

1. **AI Mastery Membership** ($999/year individual, $299-399/year business)
   - 12 months of **on-demand access** to all courses
   - **Self-paced learning** - no instructor facilitation
   - Employees learn independently at their own speed
   
2. **Course Structure:**
   - Pre-recorded video courses
   - Self-study materials
   - Earn certificates independently
   - "Learn at your own pace"
   
3. **Live Components (Optional Add-ons):**
   - Quarterly AMA sessions with founder
   - AI Academy Live master classes
   - These are **supplemental**, not core delivery
   
4. **No Manager Facilitation:**
   - Employees access courses directly
   - Self-directed learning paths
   - Individual progress tracking
   - Certificates issued to individuals (not teams)

5. **Business Accounts:**
   - Companies purchase licenses for employees
   - Employees learn independently
   - Admin console for tracking (not teaching)
   - "Customized learning paths" = employee chooses their path

### Critical Insight:

**MANAGERS DO NOT DELIVER TRAINING**

- Managers purchase access
- Employees complete training themselves
- Platform provides content, not manager
- Self-paced, asynchronous learning model

## Implications for Prompted Business Edition:

### Current Problem:
Your workbook is written as if **managers will facilitate training sessions** with their teams. This does NOT match how elite corporate AI training works.

### Required Changes:

1. **Reframe from "Manager-Led" to "Employee Self-Directed"**
   - Remove "Training Session Plans" language
   - Remove "Educator/Manager facilitates" instructions
   - Focus on individual employee learning journey

2. **Update Language:**
   - ❌ "Managers implement this training"
   - ✅ "Complete this module at your own pace"
   
   - ❌ "Training Session 1: Deliver to your team"
   - ✅ "Module 1: Self-Paced Learning"
   
   - ❌ "Manager Planning Tool"
   - ✅ "Individual Planning Worksheet"

3. **Reposition Manager Role:**
   - Managers = **Purchasers** and **Progress Monitors**
   - NOT trainers or facilitators
   - Provide manager dashboard/reporting tools
   - NOT manager training scripts

4. **Focus on Individual Learner:**
   - "You will learn..."
   - "Complete this exercise..."
   - "Track your progress..."
   - "Earn your certificate..."

## Competitive Analysis:

### SmarterX Model:
✅ Self-paced courses
✅ Individual certificates
✅ Employee-directed learning
✅ Manager dashboard for tracking
❌ NO manager-led training sessions

### Your Current Model:
❌ Manager-facilitated sessions
❌ Training session scripts
❌ "Deliver to your team" language
✅ Individual worksheets (good!)

### Gap to Close:
**Completely reframe from manager-facilitated to employee self-directed**

This is a fundamental shift in delivery model, not just language tweaks.
