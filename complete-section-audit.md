## CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:

### Section 12: Subject Guides
❌ Has K-12 school subjects (English, Math, Science, Social Studies)
❌ Content about Shakespeare, Macbeth, literary analysis
→ REPLACE with business departments: Marketing, HR, Operations, Sales, Finance, IT

### Section 14: Professional Development Tools  
❌ Has "Supervisor Communication" section
❌ "Generate Letter" button for parents/guardians
❌ References to "home languages" and "supervisors/guardians"
→ REMOVE all supervisor/parent communication features

### Additional Issues to Check:
- Search for any remaining "student", "teacher", "classroom", "homework" language
- Check dropdown menus for K-12 subjects
- Verify all examples are business-appropriate
- Ensure no empty/broken sections
